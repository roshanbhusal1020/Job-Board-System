# Job Board Platform (WIP)

This is a full-stack job board application designed for job seekers and employers.

- **Job seekers** can browse job listings, apply, and track their applications.
- **Employers** can post jobs and manage their listings.

The project is currently under development and aims to be a simple, modern platform for connecting applicants and employers.

##  Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Java, Spring Boot (REST API, session-based authentication)
- **Frontend**: React.js (migrated from plain HTML/JavaScript)
- **Database**: MySQL

##  Features (Completed)

- User registration and login (session-based)
- Employer and applicant role support
- Job posting, browsing, and applying
- Basic dashboard for each user type

##  Planned Features

These are planned features that I intend to implement next:

-  **Resume Feedback Bot**  
  Upload a CV and get basic, AI-generated feedback to improve it.

-  **Interview Tracker**  
  Track application status, interview stages, and receive follow-up reminders.

-  **Project Suggestions**  
  Suggest small project ideas based on job listings to help users build relevant portfolio items.

-  **Trends Dashboard**  
  A visual dashboard showing popular tech stacks, salary trends, remote vs. onsite ratio, and more.

##  Motivation

I built this project to practice full-stack development using Java and React, and to showcase features that could actually help graduates like myself especially during the job hunt.

##  Note

The project is still a **work in progress** with many features yet to be added. I'm actively working on it.

Feel free to explore the code and suggest improvements.
